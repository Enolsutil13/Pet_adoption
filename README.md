## Pet Adoption Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks

This project uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the probability of pet adoption. The model is trained on historical data and uses relevant features to make accurate predictions.

# Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the probability of a pet being adopted. We use an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented with Keras and TensorFlow to achieve this goal. The model is trained with a data set containing information about pets and their characteristics.
